\section{Assumption}
1.2Dimensional motion: Our rockets only consider 2Dimension,x-z flat (The z-axis points upward, and the x-axis is horizontal.)\\
2.rigid body: The rocket is treated as a rigid body, meaning it does not deform during flight.\\
3.Translation and rotation: The rocket's motion includes both translation (movement through space) and rotation (spinning around its center of mass).\\
4.Aerodynamic force only acts as drag.\\
5.Gravity acts downward along the z-axis with a constant acceleration of \( g = 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \).\\
6.constant air density of \( \rho = 1.225 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \) (sea level standard conditions).\\

\section{Coordinate system and state variables}

\subsection{1.Definition of system coordinate }
1.Inertial frame of reference: origin at launch point\\
2.Body axis system: origin at the center of gravity (CG), $\hat{x}_b$forward along the rocket's longitudinal axis, $\hat{y}_b$laterally (right-hand rule), and $\hat{z}_b$upward.\\
\subsection{2.State variables}
We can use 6 variables to describe the state of the rocket at any time \( t \):
$s(t)=\begin{bmatrix}
 x(t)\\
 z(t)\\
 v_x(t)\\
 v_z(t)\\
 \theta(t) \\
 \omega(t)
\end{bmatrix}$\\
where:\\
\( x(t) \): Horizontal position of the rocket's center of mass (CG) at time \( t \).\\
\( z(t) \): Vertical position of the rocket's center of mass (CG) at time \( t \).\\
\( v_x(t) \): Horizontal velocity component of the rocket at time \( t \).\\
\( v_z(t) \): Vertical velocity component of the rocket at time \( t \).\\
\( \theta(t) \): Pitch angle of the rocket relative to the horizontal axis at time \( t \).\\
\( \omega(t) \): Angular velocity (rate of change of pitch angle) of the rocket at time \( t \).\\
\(\omega = \frac{d\theta}{dt}\)\\
